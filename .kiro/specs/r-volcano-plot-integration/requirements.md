# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds R-based Volcano Plot functionality to the existing Next.js + FastAPI Data Visualization Satellite application. The goal is to integrate an R backend for volcano plot generation to compare performance, output, and user experience parity between Python (FastAPI + Polars) and R backends. This integration will maintain the existing architecture while adding R capabilities for technical comparison and benchmarking purposes.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a data scientist, I want to access an R-based volcano plot page that looks and behaves identically to the existing Python version, so that I can compare the performance and output between R and Python implementations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I navigate to `/plots/volcano-r` THEN the system SHALL display a volcano plot page with identical layout, filters, and interactive controls as the existing FastAPI version
2. WHEN I interact with p-value threshold, log2FC range, search filters, and export buttons THEN the system SHALL respond with the same functionality as the Python version
3. WHEN I view the plot visualization THEN the system SHALL render using Plotly.js with identical visual appearance and interactivity
4. WHEN I compare the UI elements THEN the system SHALL maintain the same color scheme, layout, and control positioning as the FastAPI version

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the R backend to integrate seamlessly with the existing Next.js API routes, so that I can maintain the current architecture without introducing new microservices or containers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the R backend processes requests THEN the system SHALL use the same JSON input/output structure as the FastAPI version
2. WHEN I deploy the application THEN the system SHALL run R processing within the same server runtime without requiring Docker/K8s isolation
3. WHEN the R backend is called THEN the system SHALL use either Plumber or lightweight R integration (system() calls or reticulate) from existing Next.js API routes
4. WHEN processing data THEN the system SHALL limit R dependencies to core packages (data.table/dplyr, plotly, jsonlite)

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a performance analyst, I want to benchmark and compare R vs Python implementations, so that I can evaluate runtime latency, CPU/RAM usage, and data handling performance differences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I process identical datasets THEN the system SHALL generate functionally identical outputs between R and Python versions
2. WHEN I run performance tests THEN the system SHALL provide measurable metrics for runtime latency comparison
3. WHEN I monitor resource usage THEN the system SHALL track CPU and RAM consumption for both implementations
4. WHEN I validate outputs THEN the system SHALL ensure consistent visual and statistical results between R and Python backends

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want comprehensive documentation and setup instructions, so that I can understand the R integration and prepare for future scalability discussions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I read the updated README THEN the system SHALL provide clear setup instructions for R dependencies and integration
2. WHEN I review the documentation THEN the system SHALL include comparison procedures between R and Python implementations
3. WHEN I examine the codebase THEN the system SHALL include lightweight benchmark results comparing R vs Python performance
4. WHEN I assess the implementation THEN the system SHALL document any architectural considerations for future scalability

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to develop the R integration in a separate branch, so that I can safely experiment and test without affecting the main codebase until the feature is complete and validated.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I start development THEN the system SHALL create all R integration work in a dedicated feature branch
2. WHEN I implement R functionality THEN the system SHALL allow testing and validation without impacting the main branch
3. WHEN the R integration is complete THEN the system SHALL be ready for merge to main after thorough testing
4. WHEN I switch between branches THEN the system SHALL maintain clear separation between experimental R code and stable main branch code

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the R integration to maintain system stability, so that existing functionality remains unaffected while adding R capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I deploy the R integration THEN the system SHALL NOT break any existing pilot functionality
2. WHEN the R backend encounters errors THEN the system SHALL handle failures gracefully without affecting the Python implementation
3. WHEN I run both implementations THEN the system SHALL maintain the same environment and deployment characteristics
4. WHEN I test the application THEN the system SHALL ensure all existing API endpoints and UI components continue to function normally

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As an end user, I want identical data filtering and export capabilities in the R version, so that I can perform the same analytical workflows regardless of the backend choice.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I adjust dataset size controls THEN the system SHALL provide the same size options (10K, 50K, 100K, 500K, 1M, 5M, 10M) as the Python version
2. WHEN I modify downsampling levels THEN the system SHALL offer identical point limit options (10K, 20K, 50K, 100K points)
3. WHEN I use search and filter controls THEN the system SHALL provide the same p-value, log2FC range, and metabolite search functionality
4. WHEN I export data THEN the system SHALL generate CSV files with identical structure and content as the Python implementation
